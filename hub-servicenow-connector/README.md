# Hub ServiceNow Connector Overview

The Hub ServiceNow connector is developed for Workspace One Mobile Flows. Although it can be used as-is, it can also be used as base from which VMware customers can develop their own connector.

The connector is written in Java and use the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/). More specifically, it uses
[Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), embedding [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) 8.5.

For a detailed, language-neutral, specification for how to develop connectors, please see the
