# Bitbucket Server Connector

The Bitbucket Server connector presents cards inviting the user to comment on, approve, reject and merge pull requests. It does this based on the merge request URLs passed as tokens in the card request.

Approving, closing, commenting on and merging are actions supported by this connector.

For generic details on how to build, install, and configure connectors, please see the [README](https://github.com/vmware/connectors-workspace-one/blob/master/README.md) at the root of this repository.
