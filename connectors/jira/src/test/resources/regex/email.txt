Regex test cases for the simulator:

RITM0010001

INC0010003

REQ0010001

ABC-1

ABCDEFGHIJ-123

ABCDEFGHIJK-456

Abc-2

ABC-3A

Please look into ABC-4

Also look into ABC-5.

xABC-6

ABC-7 should be looked into.

1ABC-8

[ABC-9] should show in the list.

ticket-ABC-10 is also good.

So is ABC-11, so it should be in the cards.

Also, we would not like to see ABC-12X but be able to see ABC-13 and ABC-14, to prove that we can match multiple in 1 line, however, that first is not easy to filter out.

And what if multiple share the same non-ticket char: ABC-15x,ABC-16,ABC-17,ABC-18,ABC-19xABC-20
